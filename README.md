## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

#### Install g++ and make
Before starting, make sure that both g++ and make have been correctly installed on your machine. If you are unsure, you can check by opening up your linux terminal, and proceed to execute the commands listed below.

To check your g++ version:

`g++ --version`

To check your make version:

`make --version`

If g++ and make are already installed, you should see something like the following:

![alt text](/screenshots/makev.png)

If you see the logs above that indicate that you have g++ and make installed, then you may skip to the next step. If you do not see them, then you will need to execute the commands below in order to install g++ and make.

First, execute the command: 

`sudo apt update`

To install g++:

`sudo apt install g++`

To install make:

`sudo apt install make`

Once you have finished the installations, you should be able to verify that they have been correctly installed by executing the `g++ --version` and `make --version` commands.

----------------------------------------

#### Download this project
```
git clone https://github.com/MelissaData/NameObject-Cpp-Linux
cd NameObject-Cpp-Linux
```

#### Set up Melissa Updater 
Melissa Updater is a CLI application allowing the user to update their Melissa applications/data. 

- In the root directory of the project, create a folder called `MelissaUpdater` by using the command: 

  `mkdir MelissaUpdater`

- Enter the newly created folder using the command:

  `cd MelissaUpdater`

- Proceed to install the Melissa Updater using the curl command: 

  `curl -L -O https://releases.melissadata.net/Download/Library/LINUX/NET/ANY/latest/MelissaUpdater`

- After the Melissa Updater is installed, you will need to change the Melissa Updater to an executable using the command:

  `chmod +x MelissaUpdater`

- Now that the Melissa Updater is set up, you can now proceed to move back into the project folder by using the command:
  
   `cd ..`

#### Different ways to get data file(s)
1.  Using Melissa Updater
    - It will handle all of the data download/path and dll(s) for you. 
2.  If you already have the latest DQS release zip, you can find the data file(s) in there
    - To pass in your own data file path directory, you may either use the '--dataPath' parameter or enter the data file path directly in interactive mode.
    - Comment out this line "DownloadDataFiles $license" in the bash script.
    - This will prevent you from having to redownload all the files.

#### Change Bash Script Permissions
To be able to run the bash script, you must first make it an executable using the command:

`chmod +x MelissaNameObjectLinuxCpp.sh`

As an indicator, the filename will change colors once it becomes an executable.

## Run Bash Script
Parameters:
- --name: a test name
 	
  This is convenient when you want to get results for a specific name in one run instead of testing multiple names in interactive mode.  

- --dataPath (optional): a data file path directory to test the Name Object
- --license (optional): a license string to test the Name Object
- --quiet (optional): add to the command if you do not want to get any console output from the Melissa Updater

When you have modified the script to match your data location, let's run the script. There are two modes:
- Interactive 

  The script will prompt the user for a name, then use the provided name to test Name Object. For example:
  ```
  ./MelissaNameObjectLinuxCpp.sh
  ```
  For quiet mode:
  ```
  ./MelissaNameObjectLinuxCpp.sh --quiet
  ```
- Command Line 

  You can pass a name in ```--name``` parameter and a license string in ```--license``` parameter to test Name Object. For example:
  ```
  ./MelissaNameObjectLinuxCpp.sh --name "Ray Melissa"
  ./MelissaNameObjectLinuxCpp.sh --name "Ray Melissa" --license "<your_license_string>"
  ```
  For quiet mode:
  ```
  ./MelissaNameObjectLinuxCpp.sh --name "Ray Melissa" --quiet
  ./MelissaNameObjectLinuxCpp.sh --name "Ray Melissa" --license "<your_license_string>" --quiet
  ```
This is the expected output from a successful setup for interactive mode:
